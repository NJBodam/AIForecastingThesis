## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NJBodam/AIForecastingThesis.git
   cd AIForecastingThesis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the notebooks:**
   Open JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and browse the `notebooks/` directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
- See `requirements.txt` for all Python dependencies

## Usage

- All experiments and analyses are contained in the `notebooks/` directory.
- Data files required for the experiments are in the `data/` directory (or instructions to download them are provided in the notebooks).
- Modify or create new notebooks to extend the research or apply the methods to your own datasets.

## Results

Results, figures, and model artifacts from experiments are available in the `results/` directory. For detailed findings, refer to the conclusions and visualizations in each notebook.
